            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>ICHARD THOMPSON was deſcended of Honeſt <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Parentage both by Father and Mothers ſide: and whilſt he was yet but <hi>very Green</hi> in years, he was ſent by them from <hi>Wakefield</hi>-School in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> about the year, 1663. unto <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity Colledge</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and thereof he was a Member and a <hi>Scholar</hi> in the <hi>Old Foundation,</hi> by the ſpace of ſix or ſeven years.</p>
            <p>Before he had fully performed his Exerciſe for his <hi>Maſters Degree</hi> (which he afterwards went to compleat at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> foraſmuch as he took himſelf unjuſtly put by a <hi>Fellowſhip</hi> in <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n. Coll. Oxon</hi>) he entred into <hi>Deacons</hi> Orders, Dr. <hi>Fuller</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> Ordaining him in S. <hi>Margarets</hi> Church <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> about the year 1668. and he received his Orders of <hi>Prieſthood</hi> from the ſame hands in King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh's Chappel, the fourteenth of <hi>March,</hi> 1670.</p>
            <p>He was no ſooner thus qualified but he was ſent by the <hi>then</hi> Preſident of <hi>Magdalen</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the Reverend Dr. <hi>Thomas Pierce,</hi> to ſerve in his Cure of <hi>Brington</hi> in <hi>Northampton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> and continued there <hi>ſome</hi> years, not without ſome <hi>ſpecial</hi> Marks of Favour from the Right Honourable the Earl of <hi>Sunderland,</hi> who lived in that Pariſh.</p>
            <p>But Dr. <hi>Pierce</hi> being made <hi>Dean</hi> of <hi>Sarum,</hi> about the year 1675. he quitted that <hi>Curacy,</hi> as the other did his <hi>Living,</hi> and went upon Invitation given him, to live with the Dean in his own Houſe at <hi>Sarum;</hi> where he ſoon after in the year 1676. beſtowed upon him, Firſt a <hi>Prebend,</hi> and then a Preſentation to St. <hi>Maries</hi> in <hi>Marlborough.</hi> In the year following, 1677. he Travelled with Mr. <hi>Jo: Norborne,</hi> of <hi>Calne</hi> in <hi>Wiltſhire:</hi> But before he had ſpent full twelve months in <hi>France</hi> with him, he was recalled back into <hi>England</hi> upon the <hi>Vacancy</hi> of <hi>Bedminſter</hi> by <hi>Briſtol,</hi> which is the Name of that <hi>Living</hi> whereof he is now Poſſeſt.</p>
            <p>Whilſt he was abroad, he neither <hi>Studied</hi> at <hi>St. Omers,</hi> nor <hi>Doway,</hi> neither ever <hi>ſaw</hi> thoſe <hi>Places,</hi> neither ever Travelled over <hi>any</hi> part of <hi>Flanders</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> but of <hi>France</hi> only.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Paris</hi> chiefly, (and in the <hi>Academy</hi> of <hi>Monſieur Foubert</hi> a <hi>Proteſtant</hi>) he ſpent near <hi>ſeven months</hi> of the time he ſtayed there. And all that time frequented the <hi>Engliſh Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors Chappel, received the Sacrament whenever it was adminiſtred, Preacht twice, and Read Prayers often in that Chappel during his ſtay there,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At <hi>Gien</hi> upon the <hi>Loyre,</hi> he ſojourned in <hi>Monſieur Du Paizy,</hi> the <hi>Proteſtant Miniſters</hi> Houſe, and all the time he ſtayed there, (which was <hi>about ſix weeks,</hi>) he went conſtantly to the <hi>Proteſtant Church,</hi> and to that <hi>only:</hi> And moreover, received the <hi>Sacrament</hi> from <hi>Monſieur Du Paizyes Hands,</hi> chiefly <hi>to make the Papiſts there deſpair of warping him to their Communion, unto which he had been ſollicited by ſome offers of Preferment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At <hi>Blois</hi> he frequented the <hi>Proteſtant Church</hi> in like manner, and lodged in a <hi>Proteſtants Houſe</hi> by the ſpace of <hi>ſix weeks more,</hi> and <hi>never</hi> lodged in a <hi>Papiſts,</hi> but when the <hi>Neceſſities of Travel would admit of no other.</hi>

            <p>Yet he doth not deny but he ſought curiouſly the Acquaintance of any men <hi>more famous than other,</hi> within the ſeveral <hi>Orders</hi> that are in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> as well as of thoſe in the <hi>Proteſtant Churches.</hi> And that he frequently heard the <hi>Peres Bourdalou</hi> and <hi>Meneſtrie,</hi> (as well as the Reverend <hi>Clode</hi> and <hi>Daille,</hi> &amp;c.) foraſmuch as they were <hi>great Maſters</hi> of the <hi>Language,</hi> and of the <hi>Pulpit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He doth not deny, but that he ſaw <hi>Maſs</hi> performed <hi>twice or thrice,</hi> whilſt he was <hi>abroad, (having never ſeen it performed in</hi> England,) But ſaith 'twas <hi>Curioſity,</hi> not <hi>Religion</hi> carried him thither. And that he only went to <hi>See</hi> and <hi>Obſerve,</hi> not to <hi>Partake,</hi> and much leſs to <hi>Aſſiſt</hi> at that <hi>Moſt Idolatrous Sacrifice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He declareth that he is ſo far from being <hi>Staggered</hi> in his <hi>Religion,</hi> by <hi>what</hi> he <hi>ſaw,</hi> that he is but the <hi>more Confirmed and Rooted</hi> in it. And ſhall chooſe to live out of an <hi>Alms-Basket,</hi> within the <hi>Communion of the Church of</hi> England, rather than be tempted by the Off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Since his return in <hi>England,</hi> 1678. He hath made it his <hi>Buſineſs more than ever,</hi> to ſerve this Churches Intereſt; and <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi> in all humble <hi>Obedience</hi> unto <hi>all</hi> Her <hi>Laws.</hi> Owns Her <hi>Homilies</hi> and <hi>Articles,</hi> the <hi>Standard</hi> of True <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion.

            </p>
            <p>He hath taken the Oaths of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy</hi> at leaſt <hi>Eight ſeveral times,</hi> as his Circumſtances have required him, and how he hath <hi>Preacht</hi> and <hi>Acted</hi> in Conformity thereto, there are Thouſands in the City of <hi>Briſtol</hi> will bear him witneſs.</p>
            <p>He hath hitherto refuſed <hi>no Teſts</hi> to aſſure him to the <hi>Government,</hi> for a <hi>True Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant,</hi> and is farther ready to embrace any <hi>future Teſts, that ſhall lawfully be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on him.</hi>

               <head>The Lord Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> lately of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> his Certificate.</head>
               <p>THeſe are to Certifie whom it may concern, That Mr. <hi>Richard Thompſon,</hi> Miniſter of St. <hi>Mary Redcliff,</hi> in the City of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> is a Perſon of much more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Endowments for Learning, an Excellent Preacher, and which crowns both the former, a man of a Clean Life and Unreprovable Converſation. A Perſon free from Novelties in Religion, but very Sound and Orthodox in the Doctrins he Preaches: and thorowly Conformable as to Diſcipline. Thoſe Pariſhioners when he came to them were a perverſe Ill-principled People. His Convincing Arguments together with his modeſt and prudent Behaviour among them, hath brought them to Conformity, and made ſome Chriſtians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed who before he came were only reputed ſo. He hath Converted <hi>Quakers,</hi> and brought many <hi>Non-Conformiſts</hi> home again to the Church. The Truth is, his Learning, Induſtry in his Calling, and his moſt Exemplary Life, may be an Excellent Pattern for all that City Minſters to Imitate. And it would be both for their Credit and Comfort to do after his moſt Laudable Example.</p>
               <p>I could ſay much more of him, becauſe whilſt I was Biſhop of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> he lived under my own Eye. I was Witneſs to that Great and Good Succeſs God did Bleſs the Great Pains he took in the place where yet he is. Himſelf and one Clergy-man or two more, was all I could boaſt of in that City whilſt I was their Biſhop. But in Concluſion, I know no Man of his Years, that better deſerves very good Preferment in our Church, than this Young Man doth.</p>
